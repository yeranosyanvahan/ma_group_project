## Overview

This page documents the `model` module which is part of an internet service provider's data analysis system. It includes functionality for connecting to a database, retrieving data, and calculating the Customer Lifetime Value (CLV).

## Data Preparation

The transaction data is retrieved and processed:
- `transaction_date` is converted to a datetime format.
- `survival_time_months` is calculated for the customer data.

## Functions

### MM()

Calculates the average monthly margin based on the last year's transaction data.

**Returns**: 
- `float`: Average monthly margin.

### p()

Calculates the survival probabilities for customers using the LogNormal AFT estimator for a year.

**Returns**: 
- `DataFrame`: Survival probabilities for each customer up to 12 months.

## CLV Class

This class is used to calculate the Customer Lifetime Value for a given customer.

### Method: `calculate_clv()`

Calculates CLV based on survival probabilities and average monthly margins.

**Parameters**:
- `t` (int): Time for which CLV is calculated.
- `customer_id` (int): Identifier for the customer.

**Returns**: 
- `float`: Calculated CLV rounded to three decimal places.
