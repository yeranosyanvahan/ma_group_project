# SocraCLV

### Group project within the scope of the course DS223 â€“ Marketing Analytics

The project aims to develop a Python package for predicting a customer's Lifetime Value (CLV) for an Internet package provider that can be applied to similar-scope companies in general. As the name suggests, the package is not just about analytics but involves a philosophically flavoured approach to understanding and predicting Customer Lifetime Value to gain meaningful insights about the long-term relationships between the company and customers.
